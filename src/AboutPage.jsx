              <ul className="policy-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Fun comes first:</strong> Players should enjoy the
                  game and want to come back each day.

                <li>
                  <strong>Positive coaching:</strong> Instruction is clear,
                  encouraging, and focused on growth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Skill development:</strong> Players learn foundational
                  basics they can build on in future seasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Competition:</strong> Players put the instruction to
                  use through structured gameplay and scrimmages.

              <h3>Why RHC Was Created</h3>
              <p className="form-text">
                Rivertown Hoops Camp was created to build community through
                sport. Coach Nate hopes the camp helps prepare young players for
                their competitive journey while developing a lasting love of the
                game.
              </p>
              <p className="form-text">
                The goal is simple: provide a camp that is organized, energetic,
                and development-focused while still feeling welcoming and fun for
                kids and easy for parents.

            <div className="form-section">
              <h3>Community Connection</h3>
              <p className="form-text">
                RHC is rooted in the Southeast Portland community and is designed
                to serve families in the Franklin High School district. The camp
                is supported by volunteer counselors connected to the Franklin
                Basketball Program, helping create a strong sense of connection
                for young players.
              </p>
              <p className="form-text">
                While RHC is independently operated, it is intentionally built to
                feel connected to the local basketball community and to give
                players something to grow into as they get older.
